# Poovazhakan

**Welcome friends!**

On Windows computers, visually impaired users often face challenges when the system sound is muted or too low to hear. **Poovazhakan.exe** is a simple utility designed to solve this problem easily.

When the system volume is below 5%, it becomes hard to detect or control sound levels. With **Poovazhakan.exe**, you can use keyboard shortcuts to adjust or unmute the volume quickly and independently.
